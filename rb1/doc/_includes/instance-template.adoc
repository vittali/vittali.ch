== Instantiate template files

The _My-Node-RED-App_ consists of two sets of files:

* files that are project agnostic and can be used without modification
* templates files that needs to be populated with project specific data, mostly access codes.

These files are available in the https://bitbucket.org/pvittali/pvittali.gst.rb1/src/master/[pvittali.gst.rb1 repository].

=== Project agnostic files

These include:

 * `.bluemix/pipeline.yml`:  used by the Delivery pipeline of the Continuous Integration Toolchain.
 * `flow.json`: the Node-RED application
 * `package.json`: required by node.js
 * `run-app.sh` and `run-client.sh`: shortcuts to run the app and the mqtt test client locally.

=== Project specific files

These files are provided as templates and require customisation:

.template files
[[table2]]
[cols=3*,options=header]
|===
|Name
|Function
|Changes

|.gitignore
|exclude files from being committed
|`app name` -> `My-Node-RED-App` since the file with VCAP
access code `My-Node-RED-App_vcap.json` is required only locally, and should not be exposed.

|manifest.yml
|tells the remote deploy stage how to build and start the app
|`app name` -> `My-Node-RED-App`

|settings.js
|the Node-RED settings file, see the Node-RED documentation
|access codes: NR-flow, NR-editor, VCAP, see <<table1>>

|mqtt-client.js
|used to publish messages and test the app
|access codes: orgId, DAT and clientId

|===


The password property in the `settings.js` file for the NR-editor access code
should be a hash rather than a plain text string.

To generate the hash, do the following.

[listing]
$ node-red-admin hash-pw
Password: <enter your NR-editor password>
$2a$08$ufCvyA.kLcV4LRdCTLFsruX.ejTq1UkxiI4FLt3oLpXvs/J1dlGA.

[[NRp, NR-editor password access code]]The result is the hash of your
NR-editor password that goes into `settings.js` as we will see in a minute.

Here are some hightlights of the required changes in the `My-Node-RED-App` project directory:


.manifest.yml
[source,yaml]
----
  applications:
    - path: .
      name: My-Node-RED-App <1>
      environment_json: {}
      memory: 256M
      instances: 1
      disk_quota: 1024M
      services:
        - My-Node-RED-App-cloudantNoSQLDB <2>
      command:  node-red -s settings.js -u .
----
<1> application name
<2> name of the connection between the app and the database.

.settings.js
[source,javascript]
----
// ...
var vcap = "My-Node-RED-App_vcap.json"; <1>
// ...
credentialSecret: "My-Node-RED-AppCredential", <2>
adminAuth: {
  type: "credentials",
  users: [{
    username: "admin", <3>
    password: "$2a$08$LUhdfsdafgasggdfgdfgerferg", <4>
    permissions: "*"
  }],
},
----
<1> The file name containing the VCAP access code environment variable.
<2> The NR-flow accesscode. We choose _My-Node-RED-AppCredential_.
For production code replace this with an environment variable.
<3> The NR-editor username access code. We choose _admin_.
<4> The <<NRp>> generated in the previous step.

WARNING: If you change the NR-flow access-code after the first time you run the app, there is - to my knowledge
- no other way to apply the change than deleting the ./node_module director inside the
project directory.

.mqtt-client.js
[source,javascript]
----
// ...
var client = mqtt.connect('mqtt://nhr9i3.messaging.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com', { <1>
  "username": "use-token-auth",
  "password": "nodejs-client-1-token", <2>
  "clientId": "d:nhr9i3:nodejs-client:nodejs-client-1" <3>

})
// ...
----
<1> assuming orgId is *nhr9i3*, yours will be different !
<2> the <<dat>>.
<3> client identifier: d:orgId:device_type:device

With all these files in the project directory we can now finish the local installation and initialize the app.
