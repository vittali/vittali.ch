* choosing the right app: the flyer in the box mentions an app that is not available anymore, the _SimpleLink SensorTag_ on Google Play is the correct one, although the CC2650STK is not part of the SimpleLink family
* granting permissions: for some reason you must grant access to your phone's location. This is not only annoying because this is supposed to be demo software,
but also the app doesn't work without warning if you don't grant access.
* also applies to the CC1350STK.

- [[[e2e2]]] https://e2e.ti.com/support/wireless-connectivity/bluetooth/f/538/t/828436[CC2650STK: Cloud Settings for the IBM IOT platform for BlueMix Free]
* currently the IBM Watson IoT platform access (as opposed to the IBM Quickstart access)
is not available with the _SimpleLink SensorTag_ app due to a bug.
* also applies to the CC1350STK.

- [[[e2e3]]] https://e2e.ti.com/support/wireless-connectivity/bluetooth/f/538/t/831544[CC2650STK: Is there a linux compatible BLE stack for the CC2650STK]
* no, this is one of the idiosyncrasies of the CC2650STK, refer to the {rTI-3} for a Linux compatible BLE development environment.

- [[[e2e4]]] https://e2e.ti.com/support/tools/ccs/f/81/t/828577[CCS/CC2650STK: Failed to launch debug session for CC2650STK]
* contrary to what the discussion suggests, the target configuration of the _uartecho_CC2650STK_ project is correct, no modification is required.
* contrary to what the discussion suggests, the {rTI-5} is currently not supported for the Sensor Tags, use the {rTI-6}.
* contrary to what the discussion suggests, the coin battery must not be inserted during debugging, the target is powered by the {rTI-6}.
* also applies to the CC1350STK.

- [[[e2e5]]] https://e2e.ti.com/support/wireless-connectivity/bluetooth/f/538/t/827756[CCS/CC2650STK: Can I use CCS and the XDS110 debug probe to program and debug the CC2650STK SensorTag]
* while it is possible to connect the {rTI-5}, see Figure <<JTAG>>, this debug probe is currently not supported for the Sensor Tag.
* also applies to the CC1350STK.

- [[[e2e6]]] https://e2e.ti.com/support/wireless-connectivity/sub-1-ghz/f/156/t/832998[CC1350STK: Downloading new firmware images to the device via the Over-the-Air-Download (OAD) service not as described in doc]
* this is currently an open question for the _SimpleLink SensorTag_ app team.
* also applies to the CC2650STK.

- [[[e2e7]]] https://e2e.ti.com/support/tools/ccs/f/81/p/831543/3077956[CCS/CC2650STK: Can't start the System Analyzer despite the README.md saying so]
* see chapter <<logging>>
* applies to all TI-RTOS based projects.

- [[[e2e8]]] https://e2e.ti.com/support/wireless-connectivity/bluetooth/f/538/t/831951[CC2650STK: Can't use UART on CC2650 STK]
* this was due to the usage of the {rTI-5} debug probe in conjunction with the suggested modification of the target configuration file in <<e2e5>>.
* also applies to the CC1350STK.

- [[[e2e9]]] https://e2e.ti.com/support/wireless-connectivity/sub-1-ghz/f/156/t/837456[ CC1350STK: Where is the out-of-box demo source code for the CC1350 and CC2650 Sensor Tags ?]
* the out-of-box demo source code is not available. Why ?
* also applies to the CC2650STK.

- [[[e2e10]]] https://e2e.ti.com/support/wireless-connectivity/sub-1-ghz/f/156/t/832999[CCS/CC1350STK: Empty project debug session not as expected]
* I am unable to reproduce the errors mentioned.
I suppose that they were related to the usage of the {rTI-5} rathern than the {rTI-6}.
* also applies to the CC2650STK.

- [[[e2e11]]] https://e2e.ti.com/support/tools/ccs/f/81/t/832755[CCS/CODECOMPOSER: Code Composer Studio 9 Installer hangs on Windows 7 SP1]
* installing the CC13x and CC26xx device support on Windows 7 Pro fails, this is a bug related to the TI emulator driver installation.

- [[[e2e12]]] https://e2e.ti.com/support/wireless-connectivity/sub-1-ghz/f/156/t/833000[CCS/CC1350STK: Setting for Power Selection for CC1350STK and for CC2650STK]
* the power selection in the target configuration files of the example projects are correct, when using {rTI-6}.
The battery/power supply must be removed during debugging.
* also applies to the CC2650STK.
