The {rTI-1} is a tiny board based on the {rTI-2} capable of providing BLE/Sub-1Ghz connectivity to your electronics design project.
The product
is can be purchased directly from the Texas Instrument web store as well as from various distributors.
The name _CC1350STK_ is the official part number, but I will use _Sensor Tag_ hereafter to make it clear that this is a piece of
hardware, the relevant software development kit (SDK) is <<sw1>>
